# Web Development Journey

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my learning journey in Web Development. It contains various files and folders dedicated to different aspects of the field, from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, to advanced libraries and frameworks like React and Node.js. 

## Contents

1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: This section covers the fundamental building blocks of web development. It includes basic syntax, layout design, and interactivity.

2. **React**: Here, I've explored the React library for building user interfaces. This includes components, state, props, hooks, and more.

3. **Node.js**: This section is dedicated to my learning of Node.js, a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side.

4. **Frontend Projects**: This folder contains the projects I've completed using the above technologies. Each project is a demonstration of the concepts I've learned.

5. **Learning Works**: This section contains my practice works, exercises, and small projects that I've done while learning.

## Future Plans

I am currently moving towards backend development and will be adding more content related to it in the future. This includes learning and implementing databases, server-side programming, API development, and more.
